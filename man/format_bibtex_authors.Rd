\title{Format author information for BibTeX entries}
\usage{
format_bibtex_authors(author_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{author_list}{A data frame containing author information. Expected columns are:
\itemize{
\item family: Family/last name for individual authors
\item given: Given/first name for individual authors
\item name: Full name for organizational authors
}}
}
\value{
A character string containing the formatted author list for a BibTeX
entry. Authors are separated by " and " as per BibTeX standards. If no valid
authors are found, returns "Unknown".
}
\description{
Converts a data frame of author information into a properly formatted author
string for BibTeX entries. Handles individual authors, organizations, and
partial author information according to BibTeX conventions.
}
\details{
The function processes different types of author entities:
\itemize{
\item Individual authors: formatted as "Family, Given"
\item Organizations: enclosed in braces like "\{Organization Name\}"
\item Partial information: sses available name parts, with "Unknown" for
missing family names
}

Special handling:
\itemize{
\item If the first author is an organization but individual authors follow,
the organization is dropped to favor individual attributions
\item Empty or NULL author lists return "Unknown"
\item The function processes each row of the author_list data frame sequentially
}
}
\examples{
# handle individual authors
authors <- data.frame(
  family = c("Smith", "Johnson", "Lee"),
  given = c("John", "Sarah", "David"),
  name = c(NA, NA, NA),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
format_bibtex_authors(authors)
# returns: Smith, John and Johnson, Sarah and Lee, David

# handle an organization as author
org_author <- data.frame(
  family = NA_character_,
  given = NA_character_,
  name = "National Science Foundation",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
# for organizations, the output will have the name wrapped in braces
result <- format_bibtex_authors(org_author)
# will return the organization name enclosed in braces

# handle mixed authors (organization will be dropped)
mixed <- rbind(org_author, authors[1, ])
format_bibtex_authors(mixed)
# returns: Smith, John

}

information in complete BibTeX entries.
