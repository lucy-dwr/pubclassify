\title{Extract author information from publication metadata}
\usage{
extract_author_info(author_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{author_list}{A data frame containing author information. Expected to
have the following columns:
\itemize{
\item sequence: character indicating author order, with "first" identifying
the lead author
\item given: given/first name for individual authors
\item family: family/last name for individual authors
\item name: (optional) full name for organizational authors
}}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements:
\itemize{
\item lead_author_first_name: character, the first name of the lead author
(NA if not found)
\item lead_author_last_name: character, the last name of the lead author
(NA if not found)
\item author_count: integer, the total number of authors
}
}
\description{
Extracts key information about the lead author from publication metadata.
Identifies the first author's given (first) and family (last) names and counts
the total number of authors. Handles both individual authors and organizational
authors with special logic.
}
\details{
This function processes author information typically obtained from publication
metadata sources such as CrossRef. It handles several special cases:

\itemize{
\item When the first author is an organization, it searches for the first
individual author in the list to extract personal name information
\item When no authors are found or author_list is NULL, it returns NA
values for names and 0 for author count
\item It specifically looks for the "sequence" field with value "first" to
identify the lead author
}

The function is particularly useful for creating citation keys, identifying
first authors for sorting, and gathering bibliographic metadata.

\examples{
# try an example with individual authors
authors <- data.frame(
  sequence = c("first", "additional", "additional"),
  given = c("John", "Jane", "Robert"),
  family = c("Smith", "Johnson", "Williams"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
extract_author_info(authors)
# returns list(lead_author_first_name = "John", lead_author_last_name = "Smith", author_count = 3)

# try an example with an organization as first author
mixed_authors <- data.frame(
  sequence = c("first", "additional"),
  given = c(NA, "Maria"),
  family = c(NA, "Garcia"),
  name = c("National Science Foundation", NA),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
extract_author_info(mixed_authors)
# returns list(lead_author_first_name = "Maria", lead_author_last_name = "Garcia", author_count = 2)

}
