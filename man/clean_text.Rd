\title{Clean and escape text for BibTeX entries}
\usage{
clean_text(text)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A character string to be cleaned and escaped for BibTeX.}
}
\value{
A character string with special characters escaped for BibTeX.
If the input is NA, returns an empty string.
}
\description{
Prepares text strings for use in BibTeX entries by escaping special characters
that have special meaning in LaTeX. This helps prevent syntax errors when the
BibTeX file is processed by LaTeX.
}
\details{
This function escapes the following special characters:
\itemize{
\item Ampersand (&) to \\\\&
\item Percent sign (\%) to \\\\\%
\item Underscore (\emph{) to \\\\}
}

These characters have special meanings in LaTeX and must be escaped to be
displayed correctly in the final document. The function is used internally
by other BibTeX generation functions to ensure valid output.
}
\examples{
# escape special characters
clean_text("Machine Learning & Statistics")
# returns "Machine Learning \\&amp; Statistics"

# handle multiple special characters
clean_text("50\% Reduction in Error_Rate")
# returns "50\\\% Reduction in Error\\_Rate"

# handle NA values
clean_text(NA)
# returns ""

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{create_bibtex}} which uses this function to prepare
text fields for BibTeX entries.
