\title{Retrieve publications funded by a specific funder}
\usage{
get_funded(
  funder_id,
  filter = c(type = "journal-article"),
  total = 10000L,
  per_page = 1000L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{funder_id}{A character string containing a valid FundRef identifier.
This is the unique ID for a funding organization in the CrossRef Funder
Registry.}

\item{filter}{A named character vector of additional filters to apply to the
CrossRef query. Default is c(type = "journal-article") to retrieve only
journal articles. See \code{\link[rcrossref]{cr_works}} for all available
filter options.}

\item{total}{An integer specifying the maximum number of records to retrieve.
Default is 10000. The function will stop when this many records have been
fetched or when no more records are available.}

\item{per_page}{An integer specifying how many records to fetch per API call.
Must be between 1 and 1000. Default is 1000 (the maximum allowed by CrossRef).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing publication metadata for works funded by the
specified funder. The structure follows the CrossRef API output format as
processed by rcrossref.
}
\description{
Fetches metadata for publications funded by a specific organization, using
the CrossRef API. The function handles pagination to retrieve larger result
sets and enforces a maximum number of results to prevent excessive API calls.
}
\details{
This function uses the rcrossref package to query the CrossRef API for works
associated with a specific funder. It handles pagination automatically, making
multiple API calls as needed to retrieve the requested number of records.

The function will stop fetching records when any of these conditions are met:
\itemize{
\item The total number of requested records has been fetched
\item No more records are available from CrossRef
\item A page returns fewer records than requested, indicating the end of available data
}

FundRef IDs can be found in the CrossRef Funder Registry or via the search
function \code{\link{get_funder_info}}. Some common funders include:
\itemize{
\item 100000001: National Science Foundation (NSF)
\item 100000002: National Institutes of Health (NIH)
\item 100000104: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
\item 100007782: California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# get up to 500 NSF-funded journal articles
nsf_pubs <- get_funded("100000001", total = 500)

# get NIH-funded conference papers
nih_conf <- get_funded(
  funder_id = "100000002",
  filter = c(type = "proceedings-article"),
  total = 200
)

# get recent CNRA publications
cnra_recent <- get_funded(
  funder_id = "100007782",
  filter = c(type = "journal-article", from_pub_date = "2023-01-01"),
  total = 100
)
}

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{get_funder_info}} for finding FundRef IDs by searching for funder
names. This can be useful when you don't already know the FundRef ID for a
funding organization.
