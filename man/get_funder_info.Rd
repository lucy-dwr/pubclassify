\usage{
get_funder_info(query, limit = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A character string containing the search query. This can be a
full or partial name of a funding organization (e.g., "National Science
Foundation" or "NSF").}

\item{limit}{An integer specifying the maximum number of results to return.
Default is 20.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing information about funding organizations
matching the query.
Columns typically include:
\itemize{
\item id: the FundRef identifier (used for \code{\link{get_funded}})

\description{
Searches the CrossRef Funder Registry for funding organizations matching a
query string. This function is useful for finding FundRef IDs when you know
the name of a funding organization but not its identifier.
}
\details{
This function uses the rcrossref package to query the CrossRef Funder Registry
API. The search is case-insensitive and partial matches are supported. Results
are typically sorted by relevance to the query.

The FundRef IDs returned by this function can be used with \code{\link{get_funded}}
to retrieve publications funded by a specific organization.

# Search for funders in a specific country
